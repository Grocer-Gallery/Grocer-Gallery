Problem Statement: Zero Hunger

Detailed Description:

"Close to a billion people one eighth of the world's population are still in hunger. "
The world does not leave us only with problems, it also has solution to each existing problems. 
So here we are with the solution of the above statement. 80% of the people in India buy the food products right from the offline markets.

Generally the products we get from markets follow this process.
Normal way : Harvest >> MNC retailer >> market >> customer
In simple words,this process consumes huge time and money. 
So this normal way is replaced by the following method,
Our plan : Harvest >> Grocer Gallery >> customer.
In this system, We get the harvested products directly right from the farmers , we process and pack it and finally sell it to the consumers. 
The way of selling this products differ drastically which brings change in reduction of cost and time.
Grocer Gallery is a website what we have created and people can get the required products from this site instead of markets. 
What makes a difference: 
In normal way, for example Consider it takes ₹2 for a farmer to harvest the rice and it would be transported to Multinational Corporation for the process and packaging.
Now the cost of this packed rice is ₹4.
Consider for example. This packed rice reach the retailer and then reach the markets. When it reach the market -> The product would cost about ₹12 
In our method,
We directly get the rice for example. From farmer which cost about rs 4 nd we pack it which would cost about rs 8 and for this amount we would be able to supply it to customers.
From the diagrammatic representation. We would be able to understand the difference.
